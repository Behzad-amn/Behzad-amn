## 💼 What I Do
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & AI**  
  I build predictive models, dive into generative AI, and work on different statistical ML models.
- ⚙️ **MLOps**  
  I set up CI/CD pipelines, automate workflows, and ensure smooth model deployments.
- 🏗️ **Cloud Architecture**  
  I design scalable systems on AWS (ECS, Lambda, SageMaker, and more).  
- 🛠️ **Data Engineering**  
  I create data pipelines and work with SQL/NoSQL databases to keep everything running smoothly.
